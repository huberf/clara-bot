## Response Text
The response itself can be written with standard text without any special
formatting. However, if wishing to convey an action a robotic version of Clara
would take use the `*` symbol such as `*smiles*`. For now, this helps the user
further engage with conversations. However, in the future a physical version of
Clara could take these prewritten actions and perform them. To future proof your
bot, this can be very helpful. Support for standardized speech markup is in the
works for changing the tone and conveyance of responses.
