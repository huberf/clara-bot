# Clara Bot

Meta: Companionship is vital to the human condition, and Clara is intended to be an
intellectual companion to its user. With robot-to-human marriages on the
horizon, Clara is intended to satisfy the romantic needs of its user and in the
long run be conscious and have the emotional ties run both ways.

This is a very early version, and is mainly just a fun experiment in natural
language processing. I don't pretend to know the societal and ethical
implications of robot-to-human interactions, but thought this would be an
intriguing project.
